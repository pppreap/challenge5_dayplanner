# User Story
An employee with a busy schedule wants a daily planner that they can add improtant events to manage their time effectively. A developer will create an application that fulfill the criteria.

The time blocks are color coded in reference to the current hour and events can be changed, deleted, and saved.
Red is the present, current hour.
Gray is the time in the past.
Green is the time in the future.

## Criteria

**You will need to run this application in a browser.**

The daily planner will be used to create a schedule:

WHEN the **planner is opened**,
the **current day is displayed at the top** of the calendar.

WHEN the user **scroll down**,
THEN they are **presented with time blocks for standard business hours**.

WHEN  the user **view the time blocks** for that day,
THEN **each time block is color-coded** to indicate whether it is in the **past, present, or future**.

WHEN  the user click into a time block,
THEN  an **event can be entered**.

WHEN  the user **click the save button for that time block**,
THEN the **text for that event is saved in local storage.**

WHEN  the **user refresh the page**,
THEN the **saved events persist**.
